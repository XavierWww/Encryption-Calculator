### Encryption Calculator
This project for designing a encryption calculator. In short, I just have implemented two encrytion algorithm: DES and RC4.

### Repository Structure
The core file is formatted as follows:  
- CN007.html 					is a web page(executable file), you can directly open it (Recommend using "Chrome" due to the compatibility).
- additional/style.css  		contains some style sheets about HTML file.
- additional/encryption.js 		implements two encryption algorithm: DES and RC4.

### About my program
You only need need to click "CN007.html" and input plaintext and key to verify the result of ciphertext (Recommend using "Chrome").

### Vedio demo
In order to avoid that you can not open the page and check the result, I upload a video demo to show my "Encryption Calculator". You can find a mp4 vedeio and watch it.
